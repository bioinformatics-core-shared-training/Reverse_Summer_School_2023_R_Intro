# Introduction to R and RStudio

# Why learn R?

* R involves creating & using scripts which makes the steps you used in your
  analysis clear and can be inspected by someone else for feedback and
  error-checking.  
* R code is great for reproducibility. An increasing number of journals and
  funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give
  you an edge with these requirements.  
* R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code.  This
  document (RMarkdown a .Rmd file) is a case in point.  
* R is interdisciplinary and extensible and has thousands of installable
  packages to extend its capabilities. R has packages for image analysis, GIS,
  time series, population genetics, and a lot more.  
* R scales well to work on data of all shapes and sizes.  
* R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on
  your computer or on the web.  
* R produces high-quality graphics suitable for publication in journals or the
  web.  
* R has a large and welcoming community - Thousands use R daily and many of
  them are willing to help you through websites such as Stack Overflow or the
  RStudio community.  
* Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform.

# RStudio  a brief tour

RStudio provides us with a friendly interface to the R statistical programming language.
It consists of four main "Panes". These can be re-sized and moved around to suit how
you like to work.

<img src="images/RStudioataglance.png" alt="RStudio screenshot" width="90%">

## Console

By default, in the bottom left-hand pane we find the console window. This is the actual
interface for the R programme. 

We can type commands directly into the console and run them by pressing
`Enter`.

<img src="images/RStudio_console.png" alt="RStudio screenshot" width="50%">

So, this area could be used like a calculator. Let's just type in something like
`23 + 45` followed by the `Enter` key and see what happens. You should get the
following:

```
> 23 + 45
[1] 68
```

Now 68 is clearly the answer but what is that 1 in brackets?

Here is another example to explain. If we type `1:36` and press enter, what
happens?  R generates output counting from 1 to 36 but cannot fit all the
output on one line and so starts another like this:

```
> 1:36
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
[26] 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
```

Now we have two lines beginning with a number in square brackets. Note that the
number of values displayed on each line may differ on your computer; it largely
depends on the width of your console pane and the font size. Try creating a
larger sequence of numbers, e.g. `1:100`, if all 36 numbers fit on a single line
in your case.

This is just R helping us to keep tabs on which number we are looking at. `[1]`
denotes that the line starts with the first result and the `[26]` denotes that
this line starts with the 26th number. Let's try another one and generate a
sequence incrementing in steps of 2:

```
> 1:36 * 2
 [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50
[26] 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72
```

There are other tabs on this pane but we shall not be covering these on this course.


## Editing pane

Above the Console, in the top left-hand pane is a text editor for creating,
editing & running R scripts. Rather than simply typing our commands directly into
the console, we can type them here as an R script.  As you will see, a script
is basically a text file that contains R commands and comments to explain what
the code does.

We send the commands typed here to the console, either using the `Run` button
in the toolbar or by pressing `Ctrl + Enter` (`Cmd + Enter` on a Mac).  

The advantage of this is that our commands are not lost, we can save the text
file for future use and it is easier to make changes to our code.

<img src="images/RStudio_scripting.png" alt="RStudio edit pane screenshot" width="50%">

A script is an R program that you have written. Good practice is for each 
script to perform only one role in your analysis workflow and so you may have
several R scripts which you call, in a particular sequence, to analyse your
data.

As well as R scripts, there are many types of RStudio document including
Markdown files which we will use in the teaching of this course. These can
provide interactive workbooks or pdf and web documents to name but a few
possible outcomes.

## Environment

Next we move to the top right-hand corner pane. Here we have even more tabs (of
which we will only consider two Environment and History).

<img src="images/RStudio_env.png" alt="RStudio screenshot" width="50%">

The Environment pane keeps track on R variables which we create (more on those
later) and their contents. History is like a tally role of all the R commands
we have entered in our session.

## Files, Plots & Help

Our final bottom right-hand pane also has several tabs. The Files tab is a file
explorer that enable us to move around our directories and select which files
we wish to work on. We can also change the default working directory that
RStudio will use.

<img src="images/RStudio_filexpl.png" alt="RStudio screenshot" width="50%">

The Plots tab is where any graphs that we create in R will appear. We can move
through them using the arrow buttons and the export button will convert them to
different graphics formats e.g. for publication in a paper or for the web.

The Packages tab shows which R packages are installed (These expand R's
functionallity and again will be covered later) and can also install new
packages.

The Help tab is a _extremely useful_ tab which enables you to search R help
index to get help pages on R functions and provide example code to help you use
them in your R scripts.

# Our first look at the R language

Our overall goal for this course is to give you the ability to import your data
into R, select a subset of the data most of interest for a given analysis,
carry out an analysis to summarize these data and create visualizations of the
data.  First though, let us consider __“What is Data?”__

Data comes in many forms: Numbers (Integers and decimal values) or alphabetical
(characters or lines of text). Clearly a computer (or R) needs a way of
representing this wide range of data with it’s diverse properties.

## Data types in R
![Image source:https://www.javatpoint.com/r-data-types](./images/r-programming-data-types.png)


R has 6 basic data types:

* __character__  
    * a "character" is nothing but a series of letters, numbers and punctuation
      marks. You will often see this referred to as a *string*. 
    * anything between two quotes (Single or double quotes): "a", 'cat'  
    * Quoted numbers are character type: '3.14'  
* __double__:     
    * Set of all real numbers  
    * Could be a integer or include a decimal: 10, 3.14, 1.45765, 5, 1000000  
* __integer__: Whole numbers. 5L (the "L" tells R to store this as an integer)  
* __logical__: TRUE, FALSE  
* __complex__: 1+4i (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)  
* __raw__: Holds raw bytes  

The last two data types are rarely used in practice.

We will learn about an additional specialist data class __factor__ in the next
session.

__double__ and __integer__ both have the additional type __numeric__.

There are some additional specialist data types, such as dates, but we wont be
dealing with them in this course.

Different types of data are needed in programming for a variety of reasons:

* Some commands can only be used on particular data types. For instance
mathematical operations (+, -, x and /) are only meaningful for numbers.
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
11 + 3 # Operation of addition performed correctly
"11" + 3 # gives error
```
* Efficient storage, e.g. the __integer__ type uses less memory than the
  __double__ (decimal) data type.

## Data structures in R

![Image source:http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html](./images/dataStructures.png)

R has many data structures. These include:

* Atomic vector  
* data frame  
* matrix  
* list  
* factors  


### Atomic vector


The atomic vector is the fundamental data structure in R and all the other data
structures built on vectors.

We can assign a value to an object with a name:

```{r}
x <- 100
```
Here we are creating an object called `x` containing the value '100'.

**Note**: The terms `object` and `variable` are often used interchangeably,
even though they do have sublty different meanings.

The assignment operator `<-` causes the value 100 to be assigned to the
variable named `x`.  

**Note**: you can also use `=` instead of `<-`, however, best
practice is to use `<-`.

```{r}
x <- 100
x = 100
```

After a variable/object is created, it can be used as many times as needed.

```{r}
y <- 10
y * y
y + y
100 + y
```

The values assigned to a variable can be replaced:

```{r}
x <- "Tom"
x
x <- "Jerry"
x
```

Variable names can not start with a number or a special characters like (\_,
  -, \*, etc)

```{r, error = TRUE}
2x <- 100
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
_x <- 100
```

The only special characters allowed in variable names are "\_" and "." any
other special character throws an error]

```{r, error = TRUE}
my-name <- "Ashley"
```

To R the "-" symbol means minus, so it is interpreting the first part of the
line as an instruction to subtract the value of variable called "name" from
the value of a variable called "my", however, neigther of these exists, so it
throws an error.

```{r}
my_name <- "Ashley"
my.name <- "Ashley"
```

* R is case sensitive 
* COUNTRY and country are two different variables
```{r}
COUNTRY <- "United Kingdom"
country <- "Uganda"

COUNTRY
country
```

#### Atomic vectors with more than one value

* The `c()` function should be used to create a vector that holds more than one value
* c stands for combine
* values are separated by ","

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- 100, 200
```

```{r}
x <- c(100, 200)
```

* the ":" operator that generates a range of values

```{r}
x <- 1:40
x
```

The values in a vector must all be of the same data type, such as numerics,
integers, characters, logic, complexes, or raw data.

When we attempt to mix different data types in a single vector, R automatically
converts the data types, this phenomenon is called
[Coercion](https://www.zigya.com/blog/what-is-coercion-in-r/)

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
typeof(x)
x <- c(1, "2", 3, 4)
typeof(x)

z <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
typeof(z)

z <- c(TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE")
z
typeof(z)

y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, 1L)
y
typeof(y)
```

#### A note on logical vectors

The logical values "TRUE" and "FALSE" are internally represented as 1 and 0.
Therefore mathematical operations can be performed on these vectors.

```{r}
y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
y
sum(y)
mean(y)
```


### Vectorization in R

It is important to note that most of R's functions are **vectorized**, which
means that they operate on all elements of a vector without looping through
each element one by one. Coding becomes more concise, easier to read, and less
prone to errors as a result.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x * 5
x + 1
```

Vectorization is powerful, quick and concise, but leads to confusion when
vector lengths are different.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
x + y
```


```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(1, 2)
x + y
```

![](./images/vector_recycling.png)
  
### Accessing specific elements of an atomic vector  

If a vector contains more than one value, we may times only wish to access
specific values within the vector. To this we use the `[]` subscript operator.

Within `[]` one can give any of the following:    

* Vector of index numbers   
* Vector of logical values

![](./images/atomic_vector.png)

#### Using integer vector containing index numbers

```{r}
vec <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
vec
```

To extract 4th value from the vector:

```{r}
vec[4]
```

To extract 4th and 7th values from the vector:

```{r}
vec[c(4, 7)]
```

We can also invert the selection using "-" symbol, e.g. to extract all the
values except 4th and 7th values:

```{r}
vec[c(-4, -7)]
```

It is also possible to selectively replace specific vector values using the
same notation.

```{r}
x <- c(10, 20, 30)
x[2]
x[2] <- 1000
x
```

#### Using a logical vector to select values from a vector

We can also extract values using a vector of logical values. Normally the
logical vector should be the same lenght as the vector from which we are
extracting values, however, if it is shorter then it will be recycled as
necessary - this can be confusing.

```{r}
y <- c(5, 8, 10)
myLogicalVec <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
y[myLogicalVec]
vec[myLogicalVec]
```

In practice we do not create logical vectors manually, they are most usually
generated as the outputs of boolean comparison. This allows us to select values
from a vector based on their characteristics.  

The basic comparison operators are:  

```{r echo = FALSE}
tab <- data.frame(Operator = c("==",   "!=", ">", "<", ">=", "<="),
                  Meaning = c("Equal to", "Not equal to", "Greater than",
                              "Less than", "Greater than or equal to",
                              "Less than or equal to"),
                  Example = c("100 == 90", "100 != 90", "100 > 90", "100 < 90", "100 >= 90", "90 <= 90"),
                  Result = c("FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE"))
knitr::kable(tab)
```

We will encounter other functions that can also generate logical vectors using
more complex tests later in the course.

Using these comparison operators we can test each of value in a vector and
generate a logical vector that tells us which values match our criteria.
  
For example, to only keep values that are greater than 20:

```{r}
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
x == 20
x > 20

keep <- x > 20
keep
x[keep]
x[ x > 20 ]
```

By using logical operators one can create complex expression for more complex
subsetting. The logical operators are: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
tab <- data.frame(Operator = c("&", "|", "!"),
           Meaning = c("AND", "OR", "NOT"), 
           Effect  = c("Connects two expressions into one. Both expressions must be true for the overall expression to be true",
                       "Connects two expressions into one. One or both of the expressions must be true for the overall expression to be true. It is only necessary for one to be true, it doesn't matter which",
                       "Inverts the \"truth\" of the expression - FALSE becomes TRUE and TRUE becomes FALSE"))
knitr::kable(tab)
```

For instance if you want to extract all the values in a vector that are greater
than 10 but less than 40

```{r}
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
x[x > 10]
x[x < 40]
x[ x > 10 & x < 40]
```

We could use "!=" to select all values not equal to 20, but to demostrate the
"!" (NOT) operator, we could also do:

```{r}
x[ !x == 20 ]
```

### Converting the class of vector from one data type to another

We can convert the data type of a vector to different classes  using the "as"
family of functions:

* `as.character()`: convert to character type data
* `as.numeric()`: convert to numerics vector
* `as.integer()`: convert to integer vector
* `as.logical()`: convert to logical vector

This will have different effects depending on the original class of the vector.

For example it is perfectly sensible that we could convert an integer vector to
a character vector:

```{r}
x <- 1:5
x
as.character(x)
```

On the other hand there is usually no logical way we could convert a character
vector qo an integer vector:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "orange")
x
as.integer(x)
```

Except where the value is a number:

```{r}
x <- c("Blue", "23", "45", "9.89", "Red")
x
as.integer(x)
```

Note that as we specified `as.integer`, rather than `as.numeric` "9.89" was converted to 9.

```{r}
as.numeric(x)
```

A logical vector can be converted to either character or integer:

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
x
as.character(x)
as.integer(x)
```

### Testing the class of an object

We can perform a logical test on an object to determine it's data class using the "is.XXX" family of functions:

* is.character(): to test if the object holds character type data  
* is.double(): to test if the object holds decimal type data  
* is.numeric(): to test if the object holds numeric type data  
* is.integer(): to test if the object holds integer type data  
* is.logical(): to test if the object holds logical type data  
  
The output of this family of functions is a logical value TRUE or FALSE

We can also test for the type of data structure

* is.vector(): To determine if the object is a vector  
* is.matrix(): To determine if the object is a matrix  
* is.data.frame(): To determine if the object is a data frame  

```{r}
x <- 1:100
typeof(x)
is.integer(x)
is.vector(x)
is.matrix(x)
```

## R Arithmetic Operators

Mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication are performed using various operators. Here is a list of R's arithmetic operators.
  
  * Addition: +
  * Subtraction: -
  * Multiplication: *
  * Division: /
  * Integer division: %/%
  * Modulus (Remainder from division): %%
  * Exponent: ^

For example 

```{r}
5 * 5

3 ^ 3

7 / 3

7 %/% 3

7 %% 3
```

## Functions and their arguments

Functions are a fundamental building block of R code. Functions are "canned
scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations,
assignments, etc. Functions are contained in packages. There are a number of
packages that are automatically loaded when you start that provide basic
functions e.g. `mean` or `c`. We can also extend the number of functions
avaiable by importing additional R packages (more on that later). 

A function usually takes one or more inputs called arguments. Functions often
(but not always) return a value. A typical example would be the function
`round()`. The input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in
fact, the output) is the rounded number.  Executing a function (‘running it’)
is referred to as "calling" the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r}
round(pi)
```

`round` is a function that takes at least one number and returns a number that
rounded to the nearest integer.

In R function calls always have the same syntax, which is the function name
followed by `()`.

The arguments that you need to specify between the `()` will depend on the
function - the names and numbers of arguments vary from function to function.
The best way to learn how to use a particular function is to access the
documentation page for that function. You can do this in number of ways:

* How to get help in R details: https://www.r-project.org/help.html
* By typing `?` followed by the name of the function in the console, e.g.
  `?round`
* By using the `help()` function, e.g. help("round") - note the quotes around
  the work "round"
* In RStudio under the help tab one can search for a given function
* Use your favourite browser to search the web, e.g. "R round documentation"

```{r eval = FALSE}
?round
```

From the documentation page, you can see that `round()` takes exactly two
arguments:  

* x: a numeric vector
* digits: integer indicating the number of decimal places to round
  
```{r}
round(x = pi, digits = 0)
round(x = pi, digits = 2)
round(x = pi, digits = 4)
```

As long as you use argument names, the order of the arguments does not matter.

```{r}
round(digits = 4, x = pi)
```

As long as you provide the arguments in the correct order, then you don't need to use the names.

```{r}
round(pi, 4)
```

**However**, it is best practice to use the names for at least everything but
the first argument, rather than relying on being able to remember what the
arguments are when you come back to your code at a later date.

```{r}
round(pi, digits = 4)
```

It also avoids inadvertent mistakes:

```{r}
round(4, pi)
```

This worked, but it's not what I meant. In a more complex function, with many
arguments, this would be hard to spot.


Some useful math/stat functions in R:  

* `max()`: maximum value in a numeric vector
* `min()`: minimum value in a numeric vector
* `range()`: vector of min and max
* `sum()`: sum of a vector
* `mean()`: mean of a vector
* `median()`: median of a vector
* `var()`: variance of a vector
* `sd()`: standard deviation of a vector
* `sort()`: sorted version of a vector
* `length()`: length of an object
* `cor()`: correlation of x and y
  
Data type conversion functions - the `as."datatype"` family of functions are
useful for converting one data type to other:  

* `as.numeric()`  
* `as.character()`  
* `as.integer()`  

  

## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are
represented in vectors as NA.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return NA if the data you
are working with include missing values. This feature makes it harder to
overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data. For some functions
you can add the argument na.rm = TRUE to calculate the result while ignoring
the missing
values.


```{r}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The function `is.na()` is useful to identify missing data in your data set. It
generates a logical vector that tells whether or not each value is missing. We
could then use this to omit missing values for function that do not include the
`na.rm` argument, or just to remove them from the dataset entirely.

```{r}
missingValues <- is.na(heights)
missingValues
cleanedHeights <- heights[!missingValues]
cleanedHeights
```

# Challenges

:::exercise
1. You have been given a list of tumour volumes from 5 patients, 2.1, 1.9, 2.6,
   1.8, and 3 $cm^3$. Create a vector in R containing this data. Then get the
   following characteristics of data by applying some of the functions listed
   above.  
    a. How many observations we have?
    b. What is the mean tumour volume?
    c. How many patients has tumour volume less than 2 $cm^3$?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

First create the vector using the `c()` function and assign it to a variable.

```{r}
tumourVol <- c(2.1, 1.9, 2.6, 1.8,3)
```

We can use the `length()` function to find the number of values in a vector.

```{r}
length(tumourVol)
```

The `mean()` function will give us the mean volume.

```{r}
mean(tumourVol)
```

First test the vector using the "<" operator to generate a logical vector and
then use `sum()` to determine how many of these are "TRUE".

```{r}
isSmall <- tumourVol < 2
sum(isSmall)
```

2. You have given two vectors of observations:

         data1 <- c(10, 9, 7, 6, 7, 3, 7, 5, 6, 6)
         data2 <- c(5, 2, 10, 7, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 4)

    a. use the function `cor()` to get the correlation coefficient
    b. Can you identify the default correlation method the `cor()` function uses? For help use `help()` or `?`
    c. Can you get Spearman correlation coefficient for these two vectors? 

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Challenge 2a: use the function `cor()` to get the correlation coefficient:

```{r}
data1 <- c(10, 9, 7, 6, 7, 3, 7, 5, 6, 6)
data2 <- c(5, 2, 10, 7, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 4)
cor(x=data1, y=data2)
```

Challenge 2b: Can you identify the default correlation method the `cor()` function uses?

```{r eval = FALSE}
?cor
```

According to the help in the 'cor' file, if no method is specified by default
the function will use the 'pearson' method.

Challenge 2c: Can you get Spearman correlation coefficient for these two vectors?

```{r}
cor(x=data1, y=data2, method = "spearman")
```

4. What is the output of following operations and explain your logic behind it.
    a. c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) * 2
    b. c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) * c(1, 2)
    c. c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) + c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Challenge 4a: c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) * 2
```{r ex_4, purl=FALSE}
c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) * c(2)
```

Since the shorter vector has only one value, every value of the longer vector
is multiplied by the value of the shorter vector.

Challenge 4b: c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) * c(1,2)
```{r}
c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) * c(1,2)
```

Since the shorter vector has only two values, these two values are sequentially
recycled to multiply the longer vector's values.

Challenge 4c: c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) + c(1,2,3,4,5)
```{r}
c(5, 2, 9, 1, 13) + c(1,2,3,4,5)
```

Due to the fact that both vectors have the same length, values are sequentially
added together
